/**
 * The variables the runtime fills in by itself, and what each one holds.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS WRITTEN DOWN
 *
 * A template is a string with `{{placeholders}}` in it, and an author has no way to
 * discover which placeholders will actually be filled. Get one wrong and the failure
 * is quiet in the worst way: an optional `{{headcount}}` that nothing supplies reaches
 * the model as the literal text `{{headcount}}`, and the model invents a number to go
 * with it. That is the grounding failure the safety rules exist to prevent, caused by
 * a typo.
 *
 * So this list is the contract between an author and whatever renders their template.
 * It is deliberately identical to LMS K-12's copy: the variables are about the shape
 * of a screen — its rows, its figures, its filters — not about schools, so the same
 * names describe a competency matrix as well as a fee ledger. Keeping them identical
 * is what lets a template written in one product be read in the other.
 *
 * If a caller gains a variable, it belongs here too; if one is renamed here without
 * being renamed there, the editor is lying and the templates it produces break
 * silently.
 *
 * `grounding` MARKS THE ONES THAT CARRY DATA
 *
 * `records` and `metrics` are the facts. A template whose user prompt omits both is
 * asking the model to summarise a page it was never shown, which it will cheerfully
 * do from general knowledge. The editor uses this flag to warn about exactly that.
